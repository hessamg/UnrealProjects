# TinyTanks 
### Developed on Unreal Engine 4.25.4.
### This is a simple game with simple but refined  mechanics, game rules and full game loops with win and lose conditions.
### The focus of this game was to get a better understanding of sharing logic between player controlled and AI controlled pawns, implementing components and effects to make the game more realistic. 
### In the game you control a tiny tank and your task is to take out all the enemies turrets around the level.
